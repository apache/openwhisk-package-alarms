# Apache OpenWhisk Alarm Package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/apache/openwhisk-package-alarms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/openwhisk-package-alarms)

The `/whisk.system/alarms` package can be used to fire a trigger at a specified frequency. Alarms are useful for setting up recurring jobs or tasks, such as invoking a system backup action every hour.

The package includes the following feeds.

| Entity | Type | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/whisk.system/alarms` | package | - | Alarms and periodic utility. |
| `/whisk.system/alarms/interval` | feed | minutes, trigger_payload, startDate, stopDate | Fire Trigger event on an interval based schedule. |
| `/whisk.system/alarms/once` | feed | date, trigger_payload, deleteAfterFire | Fire Trigger event once on a specific date. |
| `/whisk.system/alarms/alarm` | feed | cron, trigger_payload, startDate, stopDate | Fire Trigger event on a time-based schedule using cron. |

## Firing a trigger event periodically on an interval based schedule

The `/whisk.system/alarms/interval` feed configures the Alarm service to fire a Trigger event on an interval based schedule. The parameters are as follows:

- `minutes` (*required*): An integer representing the length of the interval (in minutes) between trigger fires.

- `trigger_payload` (*optional*): The value of this parameter becomes the content of the Trigger every time the Trigger is fired.

- `startDate` (*optional*): The date when the first trigger will be fired.  Subsequent fires will occur based on the interval length specified by the `minutes` parameter.

- `stopDate` (*optional*): The date when the Trigger will stop running.  Triggers will no longer be fired once this date has been reached.

  **Note**: The `startDate` and `stopDate` parameters support an integer or string value.  The integer value represents the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the string value should be in the ISO 8601 format (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15).

The following example creates a trigger that is fired once every 2 minutes. The Trigger fires as soon as possible, and will stop firing January 31, 2019, 23:59:00 UTC.

  ```
  wsk trigger create interval \
    --feed /whisk.system/alarms/interval \
    --param minutes 2 \
    --param trigger_payload "{\"name\":\"Odin\",\"place\":\"Asgard\"}" \
    --param stopDate "2019-01-31T23:59:00.000Z"
  ```

Each generated event includes parameters, which are the properties that are specified by the `trigger_payload` value. In this case, each Trigger event has the parameters `name=Odin` and `place=Asgard`.

## Firing a trigger event once

The `/whisk.system/alarms/once` feed configures the Alarm service to fire a trigger event on a specified date. The parameters are as follows:

- `date` (*required*): The date when the Trigger will be fired.  The Trigger will be fired just once at the given time.

  **Note**: The `date` parameter supports an integer or string value.  The integer value represents the number of milliseconds
  since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the string value should be in the ISO 8601 format (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15).

- `trigger_payload` (*optional*): The value of this parameter becomes the content of the Trigger when the Trigger is fired.

- `deleteAfterFire` (*optional*, default: false): The value of this parameter determines whether the Trigger and potentially all of its associated rules will be deleted after the Trigger is fired.
  - `false`: No action will be taken after the Trigger fires.
  - `true`: The Trigger will be deleted after it fires.
  - `rules`: The Trigger and all of its associated rules will be deleted after it fires.

The following is an example of creating a trigger that will be fired once on December 25, 2019, 12:30:00 UTC.  After the Trigger fires it will be deleted as well as all of its associated rules.

  ```
  wsk trigger create fireOnce \
    --feed /whisk.system/alarms/once \
    --param trigger_payload "{\"name\":\"Odin\",\"place\":\"Asgard\"}" \
    --param date "2019-12-25T12:30:00.000Z" \
    --param deleteAfterFire "rules"
  ```

## Firing a Trigger on a time-based schedule using cron

The `/whisk.system/alarms/alarm` feed configures the Alarm service to fire a Trigger event at a specified frequency. The parameters are as follows:

- `cron` (*required*): A string, based on the UNIX crontab syntax that indicates when to fire the Trigger in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The string is a sequence of five fields that are separated by spaces: `X X X X X`.
  For more information, see: http://crontab.org. The following strings are examples that use varying duration's of frequency.

  - `* * * * *`: The Trigger fires at the top of every minute.
  - `0 * * * *`: The Trigger fires at the top of every hour.
  - `0 */2 * * *`: The Trigger fires every 2 hours (that is, 02:00:00, 04:00:00, ...).
  - `0 9 8 * *`: The Trigger fires at 9:00:00AM (UTC) on the eighth day of every month.

  **Note**: The parameter `cron` supports five or six fields.  Not all OpenWhisk vendors may support 6 fields so please check their documentation for support.
  For more details about using this custom cron syntax, see: https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron.
  Here is an example using six fields notation:

    - `*/30 * * * * *`: every thirty seconds.

- `trigger_payload` (*optional*): The value of this parameter becomes the content of the Trigger every time the Trigger is fired.

- `timezone` (*optional*): This will modify the actual time relative to the specified timezone. If the timezone is invalid, an error is thrown. You can check all timezones available at the Moment Timezone Website (http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/data-loading/getting-zone-names/).

- `startDate` (*optional*): The date when the Trigger will start running. The Trigger fires based on the schedule specified by the cron parameter.

- `stopDate` (*optional*): The date when the Trigger will stop running. Triggers are no longer fired once this date is reached.

  **Note**: The `startDate` and `stopDate` parameters support an integer or string value.  The integer value represents the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC, and the string value should be in the ISO 8601 format (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15).

The following is an example of creating a trigger that fires once every 2 minutes with `name` and `place` values in the trigger event.  The Trigger will not start firing until
January 1, 2019, 00:00:00 UTC and will stop firing January 31, 2019, 23:59:00 UTC.

  ```
  wsk trigger create periodic \
    --feed /whisk.system/alarms/alarm \
    --param cron "*/2 * * * *" \
    --param trigger_payload "{\"name\":\"Odin\",\"place\":\"Asgard\"}" \
    --param startDate "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" \
    --param stopDate "2019-01-31T23:59:00.000Z"
  ```

 **Note**: The parameter `maxTriggers` is deprecated and will be removed soon.  To stop the Trigger, use the `stopDate` parameter.

- `strict` (*optional*): A boolean value that decides to add a few seconds to the Trigger. This work with only five-field cron alarms.

  - If it's true, the Trigger will fire at the top of the hour/minute (\**:**:00).
  - Otherwise, the Trigger will fire after the specific seconds (\**:**:00-59).
  - If you do not set this value, it is set to the default chosen by the operator.
  - Optionally, string values, `"true"` and `"false"` are also recognized as boolean values.

The delay is determined by the hash value of the Trigger's name, so it keeps the same interval before and after the (re)deployment.

**Note** This option can be helpful to avoid thundering herds when the second-unit errors are not critical.
